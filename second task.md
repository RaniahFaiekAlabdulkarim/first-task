to accept the software from the packages. I set up the jetson nano.

 i added a new apt key
 
 I also also updated the sudo apt.
 
 then I updated by bash source script
 
and run some core components in ros

 I configure a catkin workspace.
 
 installed these dependencies: $ sudo apt-get install cmake python-catkin-pkg python-empy python-nose python-setuptools libgtest-dev python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential git
 
 created the catkin root and source folders.
 
 Configure the catkin workspace by issuing a first “empty” build command.
 
 finally, update bash source script with the information about the new workspace.
 
 and now my catkin workspace is ready; and ros packages are into the jetson nano.
