Then, I installed Ubuntu 20.04.4 in VM.

I installed ROS.

Finally, I made sure ROS start and it worked correctly using: roscore command.

roscore command output: ![task 1 for training screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107955319/177569446-4ddb574b-6a08-4f84-b4e0-51b3888af708.png)
